Bottom of the 9th, bases loaded, full count, the home team trailing by one run. How often does this clichÃ© actually occur in an MLB game?

To answer this question, let's obtain the data from the Retrosheet website. Here is the statement required by the website:
> The information used here was obtained free of charge from and is copyrighted by Retrosheet. Interested parties may contact Retrosheet at "www.retrosheet.org".

You can download [event data](https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm) and its [parsed version](https://retrosheet.org/downloads/plays.html) from the website. I only included the regular season games.

The code runs in the following way:

1. From the parsed version, filter for at-bats with bot ninth, 3-2 and bases loaded. (it's difficult to recover the "bases loaded" condition from the event file)
2. For some reason, the parsed version does not contain the score. So I take the IDs of the games found in the previous step and search for them in the event files.
3. Recover the score at the relevant at-bats and filter for "1 run down".

I manually downloaded the data between 2010 and 2024.

This function filters for the at-bats that I want:
```python
def filter_df(df):
	bases_loaded = ~df["br1_pre"].isna()*~df["br2_pre"].isna()*~df["br3_pre"].isna()
	bot_ninth = (df["inning"]=="9")*(df["top_bot"]=="1")
	two_outs = df["outs_pre"]=="2"
	full_count = df["count"]=="32"
	
	filtered_df = df[bases_loaded*bot_ninth*two_outs*full_count]
    return filtered_df
```
This function returns the plays (and not other information) within the game that I am searching for:
```python
def get_play_data(event_list, gid):
    play_list = []
    recording = False
    for l in event_list:
        parsed = l.split(",")
        if not recording and parsed[0]=="id" and parsed[1].strip()==gid:
            recording = True
        elif recording:
            if parsed[0]=="id":
                break
            elif parsed[0]=="play":
                play_list.append(parsed)
    return play_list
```
This function recovers the score state based on the plays. ("H" without an alphanumeric around it refers to a runner reaching home; but this excludes the run scored by the batter hitting a home run "HR". "SBH" refers to stealing home.) I am not entirely certain this always returns the correct score, but it works for the cases that I checked.
```python
def recover_score(play_list):
    home_runs = 0
    away_runs = 0

    for play in play_list:
        event_split = re.split("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", play[6].strip())
        run_count = event_split.count("H") + event_split.count("HR") + event_split.count("SBH")
        if run_count > 0:
            if play[2] == "0":
                away_runs += run_count
            else:
                home_runs += run_count
    return home_runs, away_runs
```
The main program:
```python
from glob import glob
import re

import pandas as pd

searched_rows = []

for year in range(2010, 2025):
    df = pd.read_csv(f"{year}plays.csv", dtype=str)
    filtered_df = filter_df(df)

    for idx, row in filtered_df.iterrows():
        if row["event"] == "NP":
            continue

        team = row["gid"][:3]
        event_file_name = glob(f"{year}eve/{year}{team}.EV*")[0]
        with open(event_file_name, "r") as event_file:
            event_lines = event_file.readlines()

        play_list = get_play_data(event_lines, row["gid"])
        game_upto_searched_play = []
        for play in play_list:
            if (play[1] == row["inning"] and play[2] == row["top_bot"] 
                and play[3] == row["batter"] and play[4] == row["count"]
                and play[6].strip() == row["event"]):
                break
            else:
                game_upto_searched_play.append(play)

        home_runs, away_runs = recover_score(game_upto_searched_play)
        if away_runs - home_runs == 1:
            searched_rows.append(row)

for row in searched_rows:
    print(row["gid"], row["event"])
```
This prints the following events (the notation is explained [here](https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm)):

That's 24 occurrences in the space of 15 years, or $14\times2430+900=34920$ games (one pandemic-shortened season), so there is a 0.07% chance of witnessing it in each game (or once in 1,455 games).
The breakdown of the at-bats:

- 5 strikeouts
- 10 batted ball outs
- 7 walks (none since 2020)
- 2 hits (both ending the game, in 2010 and 2011)

This gives us an OBP of $9/24=0.375$ and batting average of $2/17=0.118$. So throw a strike?

Finally, we can see that the Angels game in 2016 contains `5!3/G`, where `!` refers to a great play.
